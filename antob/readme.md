Bard predictions:

I predict that there will be a GPU card which can handle a 70B parameter model by the end of 2024.
The cost of a GPU card that can handle a 70B parameter model is difficult to predict. However, based on the current trends in the GPU market, I would estimate that such a card would cost between $5,000 and $10,000.
